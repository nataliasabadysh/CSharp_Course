# _ LINQ _ Language Integrated Query


<p>(Language Integrated Query) is uniform query syntax in C# and VB.Net to save and retrieve data from different sources. It is integrated in C# or VB,Ã‚ thereby eliminating the impedance mismatch between programming languages and databases, 
as well as providing a single querying interface for different types of data sources.</p>
